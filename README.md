a) First, ensure you have two essential files for the game to work:

index.html (HTML structure)
index.js (JavaScript code for the game)
b) Create the JavaScript File:
Create a file named index.js and paste the game logic you provided in it. Make sure the code for index.js is exactly as you shared earlier.
c) Add Sound File:
Ensure that you have a sound file named gulp.mp3 placed in the same directory as your index.html and index.js. This file is used for the sound when the snake eats an apple.

Open the Game in a Browser:
Open index.html in any modern browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
You should see a black canvas, and the title Snake Game at the top.

Game Controls:
Arrow Keys: Move the snake up, down, left, and right.
WASD: Alternatively, you can use the W, A, S, D keys for the same movement

. Gameplay:
The snake starts at a size of 3 units.
The objective is to eat the red apple that appears on the canvas. Every time the snake eats an apple, it grows by 1 unit, and your score increases by 1.
The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls.
5. Game Over and Restart:
Currently, when the game ends, you see the "Game Over" message displayed on the canvas. To restart the game:

You will need to refresh the page (press F5 or click the refresh button in your browser) as the game does not automatically restart after a game over.

Additional Information:


Speed: The snake's speed increases as your score goes up. Initially, the game speed is 7, but it will increase to 9 after scoring 5 points, and to 11 after 10 points.
